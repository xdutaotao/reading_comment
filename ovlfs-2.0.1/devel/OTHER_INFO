Other information needed for structures of the overlay filesystem:

	1. directory entries must remember when they have been unlinked.

	2. inodes must keep a reference name in order to create the inode in
	   the storage filesystem when it only exists in the storage
	   filesystem.

	3. inodes need to remember the inodes in the base and storage
	   filesystems that they refer to.
