1. Complete Storage Method I/F [entered Sun Jan 17 17:31:28 EST 1999]
   Convert the use of elements in the super block information structure that
   belong to the storage method to use the storage method's structure.  In
   order to complete this, the following is needed:

	A. add an option interface to the storage method interface.  Any
	   options not recognized by the ovlfs must be saved and verified
	   with the storage method once the storage method is determined.

	B. change all references of the following elements of the super
	   block information structure:

		CURRENT		NEW
		=======		===
		stg_file	u.stg1.stg_name
		stg_file_inode	u.stg1.stg_inode
		inodes		u.stg1.inodes
		base_to_ovl	u.stg1.base_to_ovl
		stg_to_ovl	u.stg1.stg_to_ovl

	C. add a storage method operation for statfs, and change the existing
	   ovlfs_statfs function to use it.

2. Analysis of OVLFS as Root [entered Sun Jan 17 17:31:05 EST 1999]
   Determine what would be necessary to allow the ovlfs to work as the root
   filesystem.  In particular, what does the ovlfs need to do in order to
   obtain inodes directly from other filesystems without going through the
   VFS, but also allowing the VFS to recognize that those filesystem's are in
   use; it is important to allow the VFS to track the inode's for those file-
   systems even though they are not "mounted".
