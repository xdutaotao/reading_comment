This file contains a accumulation of ideas for maintaining the overlay file-
system.  See the file TODO for a list of items that still require resolution.


	1. A status file can be placed in the overlay filesystem, or in some
	   other location, and this file could be used for the following:

		- remember deleted inodes
		- map psuedo-inode numbers to real ones
		- track file name changes

	2. Initial implementation strategy:

		Step 1.  Get a loadable module with a working psuedo-
		         filesystem.
		         (completed Fri Aug 22 10:08:44 EDT 1997)

		Step 2.  Add ability to obtain information on the overlayed
		         filesystem to the psuedo-filesystem.

		Step 3.  Add ability to save changes to the overlayed file-
		         system in the overlay fs.  Plan B is to copy the
		         entire file when modified; plan A is step 4.
		         (completed Sun Aug 31 00:08:29 EDT 1997 - still needs
		          testing)

		Step 4.  Add ability to store partial updates.  This is Plan
		         A.

	3. Allow the mount point to be used as the base file system.  This
	   could be done by looking at the super block structure's s_covered
	   member.  The only problem is that the s_covered member is not
	   defined until AFTER the read_super() operation completes
	   successfully.
