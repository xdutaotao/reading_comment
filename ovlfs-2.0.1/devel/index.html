<H2>OVLFS: LIST OF DEVELOPMENT DOCUMENTS</H2>

This directory contains many useful files in addition to the source files for
the ovlfs. Here is a listing of these files and a brief description of their
contents and/or intended purpose:

<UL>

    <LI><H3>BUGS</H3>
        Bugs found during implementation and testing that have been,
        or need to be, addressed.
    </LI>

    <LI><H3>GLOSSARY</H3>
        Some (attempts at) definitions for terms used throughout the
        documentation and source code.
    </LI>

    <LI><H3>IDEAS</H3>
        Some ideas for implementing the ovlfs as well as a high level
        plan of implementation.
    </LI>

    <LI><H3>INPROGRESS</H3>
        The current status of items that are under development at the
        current time.
    </LI>

    <LI><H3>ISSUES</H3>
        Items of concern for the author that affect the entire concept
        and implementation of the ovlfs.
    </LI>

    <LI><H3>NOTES</H3>
        Miscellaneous notes made during development. Interesting
        reading for filesystem developers, especially if they want to
        laugh at the author ;-).
    </LI>

    <LI><H3>OTHER_INFO</H3>
        List of information that the ovlfs needs to maintain that other
        filesystems do not keep. This file was created in response to
        an idea to use an existing filesystem driver as a Storage
        Method. The items listed prevent the use of such a filesystem
        driver as a Storage Method.
    </LI>

    <LI><H3>OVL_STG_EXAMPLE.c</H3>
        A skeleton source file, or template, for a new Storage Method.
    </LI>

    <LI><H3>QUESTIONS</H3>
        Questions and answers. This file is inmature.
    </LI>

    <LI><H3>REQUIREMENTS</H3>
        A list of requirements for implementation. As of this writing,
        requirements for the VFS filesystem interface and the Storage
        Method operations have been documented.
    </LI>

    <LI><H3>STATUS</H3>
        Some status items. Not much here, at least not yet. Most of
        the status has been tracked as updates to the TODO file.
    </LI>

    <LI><H3>StorageOps</H3>
        A brief analysis of the Storage Method concept. Used to drive
        the original design of the Storage Method functionality.
    </LI>

    <LI><H3>SUBPROJECTS</H3>
        A list and description of major areas of work that the author
        is working on or wants to work on.
    </LI>

    <LI><H3>TODO</H3>
        List of items discovered during implementation and testing that
        need to be done.
    </LI>

    <LI><H3>TODO.NOW</H3>
        List of items to be done for the currently active development.
    </LI>

    <LI><H3>TROUBLE_SHOOTING</H3>
        Notes on problems using the ovlfs and possible solutions.
    </LI>
