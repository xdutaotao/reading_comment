file, COPYING, in this directory for more information.


============
2. COPYRIGHT
============

    All source code contained herein, except those indicated as being copies
from the linux source tree, are copyrighted by myself, Arthur Naseef.  Note
that this source is available to you ``as is'', and as such is provided without
warranty of any kind.  As with any kernel source code, there is a chance for
corruption and damage of the data on your system.



===============
3. INSTALLATION
===============

   Installation should be simple:

		1. ./configure		(this likely can be safely skipped)
		2. make
		3. make install (as root)

This procedure should build the overlay filesystem driver and the kernel
lists driver.  The overlay filesystem requires the kernel lists in order to
work.

   Note that this source was written on a linux kernel 2.4.10 system, so there
may be differences based on the version of the kernel you are working on.
Don't let that discourage you from attempting to get it to work though!

   Please look over the documentation included here for important information
and warnings on the use of the overlay filesystem.


================
4. DOCUMENTATION
================

    The doc/ subdirectory contains most of the useful documentation not
included in this file.  However, for developers, or those interested in
building a module different from the default one, the Makefiles and source
code contain comments that may be of use.
